# Streamlining Project Scoping: Key Takeaways from a Recent Client Engagement

This post summarizes important lessons learned about defining project scope and requirements during a recent client engagement.

## Fact 1: Clear Scope Definition is Critical

When preparing a project proposal, it's crucial to explicitly state that anything not described in the proposal is not included in the scope. This helps set clear expectations and prevents scope creep. Any additional requirements beyond the defined scope will require a budget increase.

## Fact 2: Break Down Time Estimates

For this project, we determined a 5-day timeline was appropriate:
- 4 days for development 
- 1 day for project management to clearly define requirements

This breakdown helps provide transparency into how time will be allocated.

## Fact 3: Consider Authentication Carefully  

We decided to completely remove authentication from the scope of this particular project. Authentication can add significant complexity, so it's important to evaluate whether it's truly necessary for an initial implementation.

## Fact 4: Evaluate Architectural Options

We identified two potential architectural approaches:
1. Synchronous with API Gateway
2. Asynchronous using S3 and API Gateway 

The client also uses Salesforce, which may impact the chosen architecture.

## Summary

Clearly defining scope, breaking down time estimates, carefully considering authentication needs, and evaluating architectural options are key steps in effectively scoping technical projects. Taking the time upfront to make these decisions can lead to smoother project execution.
